abstract = {Numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations using explicit schemes can be obtained at the expense of efficiency. Conventional implicit methods which often achieve fast convergence rates suffer high cost per iteration. A new implicit scheme based on lower-upper factorization and symmetric Gauss-Seidel relaxation offers very low cost per iteration as well as fast convergence. High efficiency is achieved by accomplishing the complete vectorizability of the algorithm on oblique planes of sweep in three dimensions.}

    abstract = { A high-order compact-differencing and filtering algorithm, coupled with the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme, is developed and implemented to simulate aeroacoustic phenomena on curvilinear geometries. Several issues pertinent to the use of such schemes are addressed. The impact of mesh stretching in the generation of high-frequency spurious modes is examined and the need for a discriminating higher-order filter procedure is established and resolved. The incorporation of these filtering techniques also permits a robust treatment of outflow radiation condition by taking advantage of energy transfer to high-frequencies caused by rapid mesh stretching. For conditions on the scatterer, higher-order one-sided filter treatments are shown to be superior in terms of accuracy and stability compared to standard explicit variations. Computations demonstrate that these algorithmic components are also crucial to the success of interface treatments created in multi-domain and domain-decomposition strategies. For three-dimensional computations, special metric relations are employed to assure the fidelity of the scheme in highly curvilinear meshes. A variety of problems, including several benchmark computations, demonstrate the success of the overall computational strategy. }

abstract = {Acoustics problems are governed by the linearized Euler equations. According to wave propagation theory, the number of wave modes and their wave propagation characteristics are all encoded in the dispersion relations of the governing equations. Thus one is assured that the numerical solutions of a high order finite difference scheme will have the same number of wave modes (namely, the acoustic, vorticity, and entropy waves), the same wave propagation characteristics (namely, nondispersive, nondissipative, and isotropic) and the same wave speeds as those of the solutions of the Euler equations if both systems of equations have the same dispersion relations. Finite difference schemes which have the same dispersion relations as the original partial differential equations are referred to as dispersion-relation-preserving (DRP) schemes. A way to construct time marching DRP schemes by optimizing the finite difference approximations of the space and time derivatives in the wave number and frequency space is proposed. The stability of these schemes is analyzed and a sufficient condition for numerical stability is established. A set of radiation and outflow boundary conditions compatible with the DRP schemes is constructed. These conditions are derived from the asymptotic solutions of the governing equations. The asymptotic solutions are found by the use of Fourier-Laplace transforms and the method of stationary phase. A sequence of numerical simulations has been carried out. These simulations are designed to test the effectiveness of the DRP schemes and the radiation and outflow boundary conditions. The computed solutions agree very favorably with the exact solutions. The radiation boundary conditions perform satisfactorily causing little acoustic reflections. The outflow boundary conditions are found to be quite transparent to outgoing disturbances even when the disturbances are made up of a combination of acoustic, vorticity, and entropy waves.}

abstract = {Time dependent numerical models for hyperbolic systems, such as the fluid dynamics equations, require time dependent boundary conditions when the systems are solved in a finite domain. The “correct” boundary condition depends on the external solution, but for many problems the external solution is not known. In such cases nonreflecting boundary conditions often produce solutions with the desired behavior. This paper extends the concept of nonreflecting boundary conditions to the multidimensional case in non-rectangular coordinate systems. Results are given for several fluid dynamics test problems: the traveling shock wave, shock tube, spherical explosion, and homologous expansion problems in one dimension, and a traveling shock wave moving at a 45° angle with respect to the x axis in two dimensions.}
